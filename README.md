# Homo-GE2PE: Persian Grapheme-to-Phoneme Conversion with Homograph Disambiguation

![Hugging Face](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hugging%20Face-Dataset-orange)

**Homo-GE2PE** is a Persian grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model specialized in homograph disambiguation—words with identical spellings but context-dependent pronunciations (e.g., *مرد* pronounced as *mard* "man" or *mord* "died"). Introduced in *[Fast, Not Fancy: Rethinking G2P with Rich Data and Rule-Based Models](link)*, the model extends **GE2PE** by fine-tuning it on the **HomoRich** dataset, explicitly designed for such pronunciation challenges.

### Model Performance

Below are the performance metrics for each model variant on the SentenceBench dataset:

| Model        | PER (%) | Homograph Acc. (%) | Avg. Inf. Time (s) |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| GE2PE (Base) | 4.81    | 47.17              | 0.4464             |
| Homo-T5      | 4.12    | 76.32              | 0.4141             |
| Homo-GE2PE   | 3.98    | 76.89              | 0.4473             |

## Inference

For inference, use the provided `inference.ipynb` notebook or the [Colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Osue8HOgTGMZXIhpvCuiRyfuxpte1v0p?usp=sharing). The notebook demonstrates how to load the checkpoints and perform grapheme-to-phoneme conversion using Homo-GE2PE and Homo-T5.

## Dataset: HomoRich G2P Persian

The models in this repository were fine-tuned on HomoRich, the first large-scale public Persian homograph dataset for grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) tasks, resolving pronunciation/meaning ambiguities in identically spelled words. Introduced in "Fast, Not Fancy: Rethinking G2P with Rich Data and Rule-Based Models", the dataset is available [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MahtaFetrat/HomoRich).
